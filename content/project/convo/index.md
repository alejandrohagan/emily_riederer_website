`convo` is an R package for managing controlled vocabularies which can be used to inject meaning into variable and file names and form performance contracts between data producers and consumers. 

Features include:

- Specifying a controlled vocabulary in R or YAML
- Checking controlled vocabulary quality
- Evaluating variables against a vocabulary
- Validating data based on promises implied by the controlled vocabulary (powered by `pointblank`)
- Documenting vocabulary and variable-level metadata 

Please see package website for more details.
