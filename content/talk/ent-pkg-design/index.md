While every data analysis produces unique insights, the analysis process consists of many standard processes and building blocks. This talk explores what data analysts in an organization can learn from open source to collaboratively create a reproducible analytical infrastructure. Based on lessons learned at Capital One, we will discuss the motivations for cultivating an innersource culture, practical advice on designing and developing internal analytical tools, and strategies for helping data analysts evolve from passive users to active contributors.
