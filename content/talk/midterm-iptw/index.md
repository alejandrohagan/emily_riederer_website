In this four-minute lightning talk, I explain the motivation for using observational versus experimental methods when measuring the impact of GOTV (voter turnout) efforts. Next, I provide a high-level explanation of a specific method (inverse propensity of treatment weighting) and demonstrate the method's ability to balance baseline traits and historical performance of a synthetic control population for credible effect estimation. 

This talk is based on my related [blog post](content/post/causal-design-patterns) and summarizes my work as a Bluebonnet Data Fellow with the Two Million Texans relational organizing campaign during the 2022 midterms.
