There comes a time in every analyst's life when data becomes too big for their laptop's RAM. While open-source tools like R, python, and SQL have made "team of one" data analysts ever more powerful, analysts abilities to derive value from their skillsets are highly interdependent with the tools at their disposal. 

For R and python, the size of datasets becomes a limiting factor to local processing; for a SQL-focused analyst, the existence of a database is prerequisite, as the gap between "democratized" SQL *querying* skills and data engineering and database management skills is not insignificant. The ever-increasing number of managed cloud services (from data warehouses, containers, hosted IDEs and notebooks) offer a trendy and effective solution. However, budget constraints, technical know-how, security concerns, or tight-timelines can all be headwinds to adoption. 

So what's an analyst to do when they have the knowledge and tools but not the infrastructure to tackle their problem? 

[`DuckDB`](https://DuckDB.org/) is quickly gaining popularity as a solution to some of these problems. DuckDB is a no-dependency, serverless database management system that can help parse massive amounts of data out-of-memory via familiar SQL, python, and R APIs. Key features include:

- **Easy set-up**: Easily installed as an executable or embedded within R or python packages
- **Columnar storage**: For efficient retrieval and vectorized computation in analytics settings
- **No installation or infrastructure required**: Runs seamlessly on a local machine launched from an executable 
- **No loading required**: Can read external CSV and Parquet files *and* can smartly exploit Hive-partitioned Parquet datasets in optimization
- **Expressive SQL**: Provides semantic sugar for analytical SQL uses with clauses like `except` and `group by all` (see blog [here](https://DuckDB.org/2022/05/04/friendlier-sql.html))

In this post, I'll walk through a scrappy, minimum-viable setup for analysts using `DuckDB`, motivated by the [North Carolina State Board of Election](https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data)'s rich voter data. Those interested can follow along in [this repo](https://github.com/emilyriederer/nc-votes-DuckDB) and put it to the test by launching a free 8GB RAM GitHub Codespaces.

This is very much *not* a demonstration of best practices of anything. It's also not a technical benchmarking of the speed and capabilities of `DuckDB` versus alternatives. (That ground is well-trod. If interested, see [a head-to-head to pandas](https://DuckDB.org/2021/05/14/sql-on-pandas.html) or [a matrix of comparisons across database alternatives](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/).) If anything, it is perhaps a "user experience benchmark", or a description of a minimum-viable set-up to help analysts use what they know to do what they need to do.

## Motivation: North Carolina election data 

North Carolina (which began accepting ballots in early September for the upcoming November midterm elections) offers a rich collection of voter data, including daily-updating information on the current election, full voter registration data, and ten years of voting history. 

- NC 2022 midterm early vote data from [NCSBE](https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data) (~6K records as-of 9/23 and growing fast!)
- NC voter registration file from [NCSBE](https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data) (~9M records, will be static for this cycle once registration closes in October)
- NC 10-year voter history file from [NCSBE](https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data) (~22M records, static)

All of these files are released as zipped full-population (as opposed to delta) CSV files.

One can imagine that this data is of great interest to campaign staff, political scientists, pollsters, and run-of-the-mill political junkies and prognosticators. 

Beyond these files, analysis using this data could surely be enriched by additional third-party sources such as:

- Current Population Survey 2022 November voting supplement from [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-supp_cps-repwgt/cps-voting.html)
- County-level past election results from [MIT Election Lab via Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=6104822&version=10.0)
- Countless other data sources either from the US Census, public or internal campaign polls, organization-specific mobilizaton efforts, etc.

Your mileage may vary based on your system RAM, but many run-of-the-mill consumer laptops might struggle to let R or python load all of this data into memory. Or, a SQL-focused analyst might yearn for a database to handle all these complex joins. So how can `DuckDB` assist?

## DuckDB key features

To explain, we'll first level-set with a brief demo of some of the most relevant features of `DuckDB`. 

Suppose we have flat files of data, like a `sample.csv` (just many orders of magnitude larger!)

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1,2,3], 'b':[4,5,6], 'c':[7,8,9]})
df.head()
df.to_csv('sample.csv', index = False)
```

`DuckDB` can directly infer it's schema and read it in a SQL-like interface by using functions like `read_csv_auto()` in the `FROM` clause.

```{python}
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect()
df = con.execute("select * from read_csv_auto('sample.csv')").fetchdf()
df.head()
con.close()
```

While very useful, this is of course bulky to type. We may also set-up a persistent DuckDB database as a `.duckdb` file as save tables with CTAS statements, as with any normal relational database. Below, we create the `sample-db.duckdb` database and add one table and one view with our data.

```{python warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
con = duckdb.connect('sample-db.duckdb')
ctas = "create or replace table sample as (select * from read_csv_auto('sample.csv'));"
con.execute(ctas)
cvas = "create or replace view sample_vw as (select * from read_csv_auto('sample.csv'));" 
con.execute(cvas)
con.close()
```

Now, suppose the data in `sample.csv` changes (now with 4 rows versus 3).

```{python}
df = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1,2,3,4], 'b':[4,5,6,7], 'c':[7,8,9,10]})
df.to_csv('sample.csv', index = False)
```

Our table stored the data directly within the database ("disconnected" from the file) so it remains the same as before whereas our view changed.

```{python}
con = duckdb.connect('sample-db.duckdb')
df1 = con.execute("select count(1) from sample").fetchdf()
df2 = con.execute("select count(1) from sample_vw").fetchdf()
con.close()
df1.head()
df2.head()
```

## Data management patterns

With these features in mind, we return to the problem at hand. How can an analyst mimic the experience of having the infrastructure needed to do their work?

One approach could look something like the following:

1. Download all relevant files
1. (Optionally) Convert large, static files to Parquet versus CSV: DuckDB handles both well, but Parquet has additional benefits of additional metadata, columnar storage, and (when partitioned) the ability to optimize retrieval with pruning
1. Create a DuckDB database with references to the files as `view`s
1. Interact with DuckDB as with any database connection needed
1. Whenever needed, re-download the files to the same name/directory to "refresh" the "database"

### One-time set-up



### Ongoing usage



## Data access patterns

With this set-up in place, analysts can then use their favorite tools to query the data.

In python:

```{python eval = FALSE}
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect('my-db.duckdb')
df = con.execute('select * from my_tbl').fetchdf()
con.close()
```

In R:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(duckdb)
con <- dbConnect( duckdb('my-db.duckdb') )
df <- dbGetQuery('select * from my_tbl')
dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)
```

On the CLI:

```
duckdb my-db.duckdb
> select * from my_tbl
```

DuckDB also works with open-source database IDEs like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.com/) for the full, "traditional" database experience. The [DuckDB website](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/sql_editors/dbeaver) gives full set-up instructions. With DBeaver, analysts get the "full" database experience with navigable access to table schemas and metadata.

Notably **if you are using relative file paths in your view definitions, there is one additional step**. (Thanks to [Elliana May on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mause_me/status/1571126401482510336?s=20&t=uYOnuHSjZcjkrbwYb0aXvA) for the pointer.) For DBeaver to find the underlying data, it must be launched from the appropriate working directory from the command line. (`cd my/dir/path; dbeaver`)
