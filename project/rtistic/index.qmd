## Description

`Rtistic` is a [GitHub project template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) which provides a minimal wireframe R package. It is not intended to be installed but rather to serve as a starting point for individuals or groups (e.g. meet-ups, classrooms, workplaces) to collaboatively build out their own set of <code>ggplot2</code> themes and palettes and various RMarkown styles. 

The repository contains many templates, scratchpads, and step-by-step instructions for a variety of styling options including customizing:

- `ggplot2` with:
  + color palettes
  + themes
- Rmarkdown with:
  + CSS styles
  + favicons
  + footers with logos
