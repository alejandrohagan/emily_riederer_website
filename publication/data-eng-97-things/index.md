  With this in-depth book, data engineers will learn powerful, real-world best practices for managing dataâ€”both big and small. Contributors from companies including Google, Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, Databricks, and GitHub share their experiences and lessons learned on cleaning, prepping, wrangling, and storing data. I contributed 6 of the 97 essays.

I contributed six chapters to the book:

- **Develop communities - not just code**: On building developing communities along with code bases and empowering versus patronizing your data product's customers 
- **Give data products a front-end with latent documentation**: On low effort practices for improving data documentation and usability
- **There's no such thing as data quality**: On the value of data "fit for purpose"
- **The many meanings of missingness**: On causes and consequences of null field encoding
- **Column names as contracts**: On embedding metadata and performance "contracts" in column names
- **Data validation needs more than summary statistics**: On the importance of context-informed data validation
