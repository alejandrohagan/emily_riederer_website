title: "oRganization: Design patterns for internal packages"
description: An overview of the unique design challenges and opportunities when building R packages for use inside of a single organization versus open-source. By using the jobs-to-be-done framework, this talk explores how internal packages can be better teammates by following specific design patterns for API design, testing, documentaiton, and more.

## Abstract

Many case studies demonstrate the benefits of organizations developing internal R packages. But how do you move your organization from individual internal packages to a coherent internal ecosystem?

In this talk, I analyze how internal packages differ from open-source, publicly available packages in their ideal level of abstraction and their understanding of specific user needs. By applying the jobs-to-be-done framework, I envision internal packages as teammates annd consider the many roles they can play, from unblocking IT challenges to democratizing tribal knowledge.

To help our team of packages succeed, we explore a wide variety of concrete design choices that developers of internal packages may make -- spanning functions, documentation, testing, and more.
