## Abstract 

In October, I joined a Halloween-themed panel along with Chad Sanderson and Joe Reis to discuss our horror stories of data quality gone wrong and how to build successful data quality strategies in large organizations. Key takeaways are summarized on [Monte Carlo's blog](https://www.montecarlodata.com/blog-scary-data-quality-stories-7-tips-for-preventing-your-own-data-downtime-nightmare/).
