I've written previously about the [unreasonably effectiveness of grouping in data quality checks](/post/grouping-data-quality/) and [implementing such checks in dbt](/post/grouping-data-quality-update/). To publicize my [merged pull request](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/pull/633) for this feature in `dbt-utils` package, I summarized my thinking on the topic on dbt's Developer Blog.
